# Skypulse Interview
This repository contains a coding exercise intended to assess the problem-solving and coding skills of potential team members.

## The Task:
Given a video captured by a drone in flight, your task is to add a feature to stabilize the video, as every two consecutive frames have been taken from slightly different camera positions.

You will find a sample video in the 'data' directory.

Please create your own branch to implement your solution.

Good luck!
