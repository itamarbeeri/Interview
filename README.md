# Skypulse Interview
This repository contains a coding exercise intended to assess the problem-solving and coding skills of potential team members.

## The Task:
Given a shakey video, your task is to add a feature to stabilize the video, as every two consecutive frames have been taken from slightly different camera positions.

### Specifications: 
1) Real-time Processing: Your code should run online, analyzing each frame and displaying it rather than processing the entire video at once.
2) Alignment: Align all frames relative to the first frame to correct the shakiness.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Your work will be evaluated based on the following:
1) Quality of your solution.
2) Ability to improve algorithm weakness
3) Code quality - How clean, well-structured, and readable is the code.


Please create your own branch to implement your solution and submit it via pull request

Good luck!
